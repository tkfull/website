**[Job Market Paper]** "Establishment-Level Unionization at Large Firms: Evidence from the 21st Century‚Äù *with [Alexander Abajian](https://acabajian.com/)* (<span style="text-decoration:underline">[Latest Version](JMP.pdf)</span>) 




<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We examine the effect of establishment-level unionization elections on the equity value of publicly listed firms between 1994 and 2023. Successful elections at individual establishments have two opposing effects on firm stock returns --- there is a small decrease in returns the day an election is filed, and a countervailing increase on the day the election is closed. On net, we find a precise null effect of union victories on daily stock returns. This result is robust to alternative definitions of treatment, longer time horizons for returns, and alternative sample selection.
