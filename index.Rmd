My name is Thomas Fullagar ("Full-uh-gar"). I am a PhD candidate in the Economics department at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) and I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market. My research interests are in applied labor economics broadly, with a specific interest in how labor unions affect firms. My job market paper investigates the causal effects of union elections on firm stock prices. In my spare time I enjoy playing soccer, reading, and taking walks on the beach with <a href="mocha.jpeg">Mocha</a>.
