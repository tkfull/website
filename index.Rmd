My name is Thomas Fullagar ("Full-uh-gar"). I am currently in the PhD Economics program at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). My research interests are in applied micro-economics fields. My general areas of interest are education and crime economics, with focuses on higher education and judicial sentencing practices. In my spare time I enjoy playing soccer, reading, and taking walks on the beach with <a href="mocha.jpeg">Mocha</a>.
